      <h3>Story</h3>
      <p class="story">Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it’s no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions – Joy, Fear, Anger,
        Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley’s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in
        Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley’s main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.</p>

              <p>She is the <span style="color:#ffc600; font-weight: bold;">yellow</span> Emotion and the main Emotion out of the five that live inside the mind of Riley Andersen. She appears to be happy all the time and full of energy.</p>

                pitfalls and risk involved in Riley’s everyday activities. There are very few activities and events that Fear does not find to be dangerous and possibly fatal.</p>

              <p><span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">Blue </span> Emotion. Sadness is the voice of reason: when Joy has an idea, she'll try and drag her down. She appears to be depressive most of the time, but there are a few instances where
                she is seen smiling.</p>

                angry. He is comfortable with his anger. It makes him happy. But when pushed too far, the top of his head bursts into flames.</p>
